# ShipIt Inventory Management

## Setup Instructions
Open the solution in Rider.
Rider should automatically set up and install everything you'll need apart from the database connection!

dotnet restore

### Setting up the Database.
Create 2 new postgres databases - one for the main program and one for our test database.

psql -U postgres 
CREATE DATABASE my_database_name;
\l to check it's there 

Ask a team member for a dump of the production databases to create and populate your tables.

\q to get out of postgres 
psql -U postgres -d shipit_test -f 08-ShipIt-ConstructPostgresDatbase.sql; to run the file

Then for each of the projects, add a `.env` file at the root of the project.
That file should contain a property named `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`.
It should look something like this:
```
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Database=your_database_name;User Id=your_database_user; Password=your_database_password;
```

## Running The API
Once set up, simply run the `ShipIt_DotNetCore` profile from `launchSettings.json`.

## Running The Tests
Tests should be discovered automatically, so just right click the ShitItTest project and click 'Run Tests'.

## Deploying to Production
